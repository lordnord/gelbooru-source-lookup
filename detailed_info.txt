Gardener's tool for gelbooru.com. It looks up for artist tag and original pixiv tags.

Before you can use it you have to edit "auth.json" file.

>> auth.json
PIXIV_LOGIN and PIXIV_PASSWORD are required so you must register on pixiv.
SAUCENAO_API_KEY is optional but without it you will can't search for source by image itself.
{
"PIXIV_LOGIN": "blablabla",
"PIXIV_PASSWORD": "blabla",
"SAUCENAO_API_KEY": "blablabla" 
}

All .json files here can (and should) be edited.

>> tag_replacements.json
Program uses danbooru wiki to find booru tag by original japanese tag.
But not all danbooru tags are acceptable on gelbooru
"tag_to_replace": "new_string" // scheme
{
"otoko_no_ko": "trap", // gelbooru uses 'trap' tag instead 'otoko_no_ko' so we do replacing
"naked_randoseru": "nude randoseru", // replace one tag with two another
"striped_legwear": "striped_legwear striped", // implication
"super_cool_tag": "" // delete inappropriate tag
}
Think of tag set as a string of tags separated by space.


>> gelbooru_only.json
Some pixiv artists have no wiki page on danbooru.
They should be added to this file. 
"pixiv id (number)": "gelbooru_tag", // scheme

Tags for new artists also should be added here.
You can use pixiv login name as tag if it looks good.
Also you can try to transliterate japanese name. (http://romaji.me)
And finally you can use artist's blog name or twitter name if they exist.

>> proxy.json

http is for pixiv
https is for saucenao and danbooru
To connect without proxy leave the file as is. Do not delete it.

example of use
{
"http": "",                         // danbooru and saucenao aren't
"https": "https://159.8.54.34:3128"  // pixiv requests through proxy
}

All insertions to .json files must be between curly braces.
Last string before closing brace must be without trailing comma.
